## Introduction

This repository provides **FIR channel models** which mimic **ultrasound in-body communication** scenarios.
More specifically, we performed ultrasound channel characterization of regularly-shaped gelatin phantoms with scattering materials, using a custom ultrasound test bed.

If you use this data, please cite "T.Bos et al. "Enabling Ultrasound In-Body Communication: FIR Channel Models and QAM Experiments", *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems*, 2018 (Early Access) (DOI 10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2880878)".
Take a look at our paper currently available at [ieee xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8531730).

## Usage

The data is stored in *.mat files*, which can be loaded both in [matlab](https://nl.mathworks.com/) or [python/scipi](https://www.scipy.org/).
The helper scripts and example scripts are written in matlab scripting language.

## Documentation

A full description of the different FIR channel models can be found on [this page](doc/readme.md), together with photographs taken during the measurement campaign.

## Examples

Example scripts on how to visualize the FIR channels, or how to use them in your communication modem, are provided in the examples/  folder.
